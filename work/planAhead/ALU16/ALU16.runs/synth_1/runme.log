If you have described an asynchronous read, making it synchronous would allow you to take advantage of available block RAM resources, for optimized device usage and improved timings.

INFO:Xst:741 - HDL ADVISOR - A 4-bit shift register was found for signal <reset_cond/M_stage_q_3> and currently occupies 4 logic cells (2 slices). Removing the set/reset logic would take advantage of SRL32 (and derived) primitives and reduce this to 1 logic cells (1 slices). Evaluate if the set/reset can be removed for this simple shift register. The majority of simple pipeline structures do not need to be set/reset operationally.
